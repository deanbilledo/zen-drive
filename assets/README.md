# Zen Drive Assets

This directory contains all the assets for the Zen Drive game.

## Textures

The textures directory contains procedural textures that are generated at runtime:

- **Terrain Textures**: Grass, rock, sand, snow textures are procedurally generated
- **Road Textures**: Asphalt and lane marking textures are created programmatically
- **Sky Textures**: Sky gradients are calculated in shaders based on time of day

## Procedural Generation

All textures in Zen Drive are generated procedurally to:
- Reduce download size
- Ensure infinite variety
- Maintain consistent art style
- Enable dynamic weather effects

## Future Assets

Additional assets that could be added:
- Audio files (engine sounds, ambient audio)
- 3D models for vehicles and environment objects
- Particle effect definitions
- Configuration files for different biomes
